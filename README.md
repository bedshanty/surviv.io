# Surviv.io Hacks & Stuff
Here I put all my Surviv.io hacks, mods, and other tips. Meant as a fun experience, I am allowed to remove these anytime. If it starts not being fun I will stop updating these. For now I will update with every Surviv.io update.

# MegaMod?
Mega mod is my ultimate Surviv.io hack. It is not a UserScript and you have to have Telerik Fiddler installed to run it. It is the core of Surviv.io modded to give you advantages, like BiggerScopes. 2x Scopes are now 4x Scopes and so forth. It has some bugs because Surviv.io's code is extremely complex. It is not likely I will be able to add Aimbot or Auto 15x Scope anytime soon. The Auto 15x Scope is extremely glitchy you have to have an 8x Scope for it to look good and those are rare. Expect modded UI. I will be updating this periodically. I don't really want to be on the Maker of Surviv.io's bad side, so if they have a problem with this than I can remove it on their request.
